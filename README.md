# SpringBootTemplate
A Template for future SpringBoot Applications based off the OVS Project

# --- Running the Boilerplate ---

  1. Download the zip file from the Github repository (do not clone, you will want a fresh git for your own project)
  2. Open the project in your preferred Spring IDE (IntelliJ reccomended).
  3. Ensure the java sdk is set up in the IDE as well as being set up as a Maven Project.
  4. Start your local MongoDB instance.
  5. The IDE should automatically detect the 'Run' class, if not navigate to 'src\main\java\com\springtemplate\sbt\' and run SbtApplication.java, this will initialise the build.
  6. If the previous steps were successful, a message should be displayed saying 'Application Started in ...'.
  7. Open your favourite web browser and go to 'localhost:8080' and you will see a message 'Example Spring Application'.
  8. From here you can start setting up your data models and structure of the project
